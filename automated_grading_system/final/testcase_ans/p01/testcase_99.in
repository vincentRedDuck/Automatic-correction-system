Yeah well, I may go through this life never knowing who I am
And why I'm here, and why I'm doing what I'm doing
I guess I'll just go with whatever my name is
And take for word everything I've learned from my father
And my father's father
They were making it up, we're making it all up
Oh, what else can we do?
Yeah, we're making it up, we're making it all up
It's the only way to get through
'Cause life's so hard but life's alright
Because I'm here with you tonight
Making it up, we're making it all up
Some people think the world revolves around them
And their beautiful child
Some people like to pile things up around them
And surround themselves with a beautiful lie
Ain't we making it up, we're making it all up
Oh, what else can we do?
Yeah, we're making it up, we're making it all up
It's the only way to get through
'Cause life's so hard but life's alright
Because I'm here with you tonight
Making it up, we're making it all up
What there's more to this life
More than what you see
It's true what they say
That life is but a dream
So row your boat gently
Gently down that stream
And keep dreaming your dream
Keep on making it up, making it all up
What else can we do?
Yeah, we're making it up, we're making it all up
It's the only way to get through
'Cause life's so hard but life's alright
Because I'm here with you tonight
Making it up, we're making it all up
