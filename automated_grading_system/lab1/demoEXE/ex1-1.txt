// Typing Exercise

Use int when you need to store a whole number without decimals, like 35 or 1000, and float or double when you need a floating point number (with decimals), like 9.99 or 3.14515.

int myNum = 5; // Integer (whole number without decimals)
double myFloatNum = 5.99; // Floating point number (with decimals)

The char data type is used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c'.

The string type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). This is not a built-in type, but it behaves like one in its most basic usage. String values must be surrounded by double quotes.

char myLetter = 'D'; // Character
string myText = "Hello!@#$%&*()|"; // String (text)


/* This is a comment */

A boolean data type is declared with the bool keyword and can only take the values true or false. When the value is returned, true = 1 and false = 0.

bool myBoolean = true; // Boolean (true or false)
